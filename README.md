## 📂 Projects Overview

### 1. [Battery Voltage Prediction Model 🔋](./Battery_Voltage_Prediction)
**Description**: Leveraging machine learning to predict spacecraft battery voltages, this project combines time series modeling and telemetry data preprocessing. Designed to improve mission reliability, the model uses LSTMs and residual blocks to forecast battery behavior, optimizing satellite operations and ensuring safe performance margins.

### 2. [Inverted Pendulum: Two-Wheeled Balancing Robot 🤖](./Inverted_Pendulum)
**Description**: This project focused on stabilizing an inherently unstable two-wheeled robot using a state-space model and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). By modeling the system as an inverted pendulum, I implemented a controller that maintains balance using feedback loops and real-time state estimation through Kalman filtering.

### 3. [Engineering Laboratory Reports & Papers 📄](./Papers)
A collection of engineering experiments and analyses, each showcasing a blend of theoretical, experimental, and practical approaches. Topics include:
- **Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)**: Visualizing and quantifying fluid flow fields.
- **Unsteady Drag Corrections**: Investigating drag forces on falling bluff bodies.
- **Lift and Drag Studies**: Aerodynamic exploration in wind tunnels.
- **2D Heat Conduction**: Understanding steady-state heat transfer.
- **Dye Flow Visualization**: Analyzing fluid flow patterns with dye injection.

### 4. [Sudoku Solver 🧩](./Sudoku_Solver)
A fun yet educational project where I built a Sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm, complete with graphical visualization through `pygame`. This project demonstrates algorithmic problem-solving and provides a real-time view of how the solver fills each cell.
